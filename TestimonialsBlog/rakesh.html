        <h2>About Rakesh</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Rakesh, an organic farmer from Gujarat. My passion for organic farming led me to start a community-driven initiative where we work together to promote healthy, sustainable agricultural practices. Through our efforts, we aim to inspire others and make a positive impact on both the environment and the community.</p>
